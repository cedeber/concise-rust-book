The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Concise Rust and Web Assembly Book.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Contributing to the code
- The `main` branch is the currently released code running on https://cedeber.github.io/concise-rust-book/.
- Checkout a topic branch from the main branch, and merge back against that branch.
- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the Pull Request.
- If adding a new chapter, provide convincing reason to add this chapter. Ideally
  you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
  
##  Before Submitting a Bug/Typo Report
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported.
  If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead
  of opening a new one.
