# Why Rust?

Rust is a very nice language. You will find a lot of information on the Web about why it is a great language.

But, what I like the most is the fact that it is **explicit**. There is no magic. Although it makes things a little bit complex from time to time. Well, this is the reason of this book.

For instance:

- in **JavaScript**, `Array` and `Object` are passed by reference. If you don't know that, you will have weird side effects.
- in **Swift**, `Class` are also passed as reference.

Another thing I like a lot, although not related to Rust itself, is the whole ecosystem. It's features complete.
