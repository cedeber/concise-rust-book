# Foreword

Hello. I hope this book finds you well.

As a non-daily rustacean - I am a daily TypeScript developer and UI designer -, coming back to Rust only from time to
time is sometimes painful. I tend to forget how to code with Rust. Although it is a very nice language, it is also a
complex and explicit language. There is a lot to keep in mind.

This little book is the book I want to always have with me when I code with Rust. Unfortunately, it will not cover
everything about Rust but, for sure, enough to let you code any kind of high-level application. If you want to go unsafe
and manage the memory yourself, this book will certainly not cover what you need. To be fair, at this level of
understanding of the language, you probably do not need this book anyway. I will assume, though, that you have already
coded before, at least with another C-like language. I hope this book will help you as much as I had fun writing it.

If you want to play a bit with Rust without installing it, there is a [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org) for
that.

- [The official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), of course, from which I shamelessly copy the important parts to create this best-of concise book. It is very well written and a must-read recommendation if I convince you to learn more about Rust.
