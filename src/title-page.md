# Concise Rust

_by [CÃ©dric Eberhardt](https://www.cedeber.fr)_.

As a not-daily rustacean, coming back to Rust from time to time may be painful, as I tend to forget how to code with Rust. It's a complex language.

Although this book will list some easy but probably incomplete stuff about Rust, in case you are currently discovering Rust with this book, I will anyway assume that you already codes with Rust before. This little book is a memory helper, so that, like me, you don't have to look at the complete library every time. I hope it helps you too.

Don't hesitate to [contribute](https://github.com/cedeber/concise-rust-book) if you are missing something or if I did a mistake. Thank you in advance for the help.
